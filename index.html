      <li>
        <p>Hey, not sure when you are going to see this. Please open on a laptop and play the song for the full Benjamin experience</p>
        <p>I didn't go to work today, I was too upset, so I worked on your website</p>
        <p>I don't want you to feel horrible and not get enough sleep. Space is really hard for me because I just feel like im waiting for you to talk to me again. I wake up and check my phone just to see whether you texted me, then feel upset for the rest of the day that you hadn't.</p>
        <p>I didn't want to have that conversation then; it was a lot. I wanted to wait a bit longer so you wouldn't be sleepy. I do genuinely think having calls when we do it hard because we are both sleepy, I know that when I call you, I've usually had only 4-6 hours sleep, it isn't healthy for me (physically), it affects my day and gives me headaches. We end up both super emotional when we are tired too, so that might contribute to neither of us having a good time.</p>
        <p>But I want to make that sacrifice just to see you.</p>
        <p>The conversation is so important to me. I've felt so tired and angry for a while, but happy and hopeful too.</p>
        <p>You feel upset about what has happened recently and don't know whether I will just "wake up and decide that you're not the right person for me". I've never done that.</p>
        <p>You have made me feel terrible about my body, you stress about things that just don't need stressing about, you've broken your word to me more times than I can count, you put yourself down, you haven't prioritised me, you've made me live my nightmare in hospital, you havn't communicated with me, you've lied to me. I spend a lot of time confused because all of this stuff is at odds with all the lovely things you say. How can you be thinking about me 24/7 since you've met me and really care for me, but then decide to do any of that stuff? The person I spend the rest of my life with wouldn't do that. The person I want to call family wouldn't do that.</p>
        <p>It's not like I haven't talked to you about it, I tell you everything in my head, even the super dumb shit at the black stairs. Every time I need you to work on something because we agree it is affecting both of us, you told me you'll work on it, and then I don't see any change. So I ask again a few weeks later when something small comes up, and again you say you're working on it. This happens again and again, and every time I feel less heard, like how you make me feel isn't worth trying for. Maybe you were trying the entire time, but I really needed you to sit me down, make me feel heard and come up and be proactive in putting a plan together on how we can tackle this.</p>
        <p>If a person is worth their word, how much is your word worth to me?</p>
        <p>My parents have always told me that I could do that most villainous shit, be on the run from the police, but still hide me without judgment, be in my corner against the whole world. The reason I've asked you that so many times is because I need to know that you would do the same for me, but I've never been sure. After everything that happened before I broke up with you, I wasn't even sure if you would be there for me in the hospital. You were there when I found out I got the job in Japan, and my first reaction was sadness because I wasn't sure you would do everything you could to come and visit, like I did for you in Canada.</p>
        <p>So you see, I've never just decided that you weren't the one for me when I woke up one day. It was the process of you being my person, then doing something my person wouldn't do, me telling you that I'm upset about it, you saying you will work on it, me believing you, then a similar thing happening again in a few weeks. At a certain point, I stopped giving you the benefit of the doubt and believing that you would work on it by yourself, so I started offering solutions. When things didn't change then, I would keep trying and trying until something major happened that upset me so much that I decided to give up and when I gave up, everything fell apart. So yes, I did feel a little relieved when we ended things because I didn't want to feel unheard anymore.</p>
        <p>All of that made me feel horrible, and it makes you sound horrible and like you're not the right person for me, but I couldn't fit all the lovely things about you on just one website, which is why I've been confused, and that confuses you.</p>
        <p>I've only ever given you the rulebook on how to make me sure of you; that is literally what the "Book of Ben" is. Yes, it requires you to put in a little bit of work, but I always assumed that you thought I was worth it. But I'll never try and change who you truly are. I love those parts.</p>
        <p>The worst part is that I know you want to be that person, the person who doesn't stress, the person who doesn't occasionally prioritise their friends over their loved ones, the person who is quick and reliable, the person who doesn't care about what other people think, the person who has so many crazy stories.</p>
        <p>Just to clarify, when I say stress, what I really mean is to stress and not catch yourself. Everyone feels stress. I feel stress, mostly about you. But it is important to not let it take over: to catch yourself. To realise you are about to put a friend over a loved one because you don't want to upset the friend, and then not do that.
        <p>I try my hardest to be that person, and I know you love that about me. I have this passion for doing and trying new things, and I've always wanted you to be in those stories with me but it just deflates me so much when you let your head get in the way of that.</p>
        <p>I think it's really telling that it has to get to the point of me giving up before you take that leap of faith with me and realise you actually really enjoy whatever it is you were stressing. In lots of cases, you are even proud of doing the new thing, which makes me smile.</p>
        <p>If you aren't ready to try everything once, if you aren't ready to question every part of belief and characteristic other than who you truly are and if you aren't ready to do something that might make you a bit uncomfortable or stressed, then maybe im not the right person for you. I try to be all those things, I'll try anything once, I'll question myself and change for you as long as you give me a good argument (usually: "it upsets me works") and its not part of my core ideas.</p>
        <p>It's a lot to ask, and I had to go through literal hell to get to where I am, but I never expected it of you straight away, or even within a specific time frame. I just wanted you to try.</p>
        <p>If you try, or at least sit down with me and tell me that you do in fact want to try, or make a plan for how it would be easier to try, you will have me forever, and we will go on so many incredible adventures.</p>
        <p>I just get worried that at some point in the future, living it up with our kids (you said "my kids" today, which upset me), something will happen and you won't try or you won't prioritise us.</p>
        <p>Any way that's enough about me...</p>
        <p>I'm not perfect out of the box either, I know that. I know I upset you many a time. I know that I didn't listen to some of the things you were trying to tell me. I know that if I were finding daily calling monotonous, I should also have done more to fix it. I know there were many times I made you feel unheard, too. I know that I didn't act like your person. I know me trying to move on upsets you, and I know the timings of that upsets you the most.</p>
        <p>I know it's a lot. I'm sorry</p>
        <p>Maybe, hopefully, I would like to think that if you told me your problems, like you have been telling them to me now, things would have been different.</p>
        <p>I've done so much to try and apologise, talking to you, writing letters, music, flowers, poems, mugs, postcards and websites all from the heart, and every time I've been burned by you, nearly every time. I will keep going, for you.</p>
        <p>If something is upsetting you, it's gone. If you ask me to be a certain way to make you feel better supported, it's done.</p>
        <p>So why do I do all this?</p>
        <p>Yes, there were multiple times I thought I "knew" you weren't for me and I'm still not sure if you're right for me. How can I be after you made me feel that way? But, after what happened, which I have told you many times that I regret, I only want you. To almost push back down all the upset with you, end things with someone who wanted me for years, who, yes, had her own problems, but as you said, everyone does, and feel the need to reach out to you is a very strong emotion.</p>
        <p>If you tell people what I did to you, they would tell you I don't deserve another chance. If I tell people what you did to me, they tell me I don't deserve another chance. So why give us one more chance? It's not rational</p>
        <p>I believe there are three layers to love:</p>
        <p>1) Love as a saying. The easiest level, you don't even have to mean it.</p>
        <p>2) Love as a feeling. Comes naturally, this one I think we both feel very strongly, it's the only reason we can upset each other so much</p>
        <p>3) Love as a choice. The hardest. Making the choice to treat someone how they want to be treated, even if it's hard. Prioritising them. Sticking to your word even if you are upset with them. Occasionally, putting their feelings and what is important to them over yours. Standing with them against the world. I think we didn't really have this one down.</p>
        <p>How you made me feel has changed how I see you. How I made you feel changed how you see me. We both have massive gaping holes in our chests, and we can either patch those up by ourselves or help each other.</p>
        <p>So, where does Japan come into this? Why is this the most important reason?</p>
        <p>Yes, everything below is true and is important. We miss each other; it's the cheapest way, it's a cool country, and I'm struggling.</p>
        <p>You don't know if I'm right for you, you're upset, and you're worried that I'll switch up in 3 weeks (even though I've been trying to make you feel better for longer than that already)</p>
        <p>I don't know if you are right for me, given everything that has happened and how you made me feel unheard and not a priority. It already feels like a leap of faith asking you to come, and that was before I made this website, did all this research and offered help.</p>
        <p>Even if you told me: "Hey, from now on I'm going to prioritise you and work on things to make you feel better, like you've done for me", I wouldn't believe you. Why would I? You've said that before, and nothing changes. I need actions to believe it.</p>
        <p>I am offering and helping you massively with this chance to help me try and make things right between us, to fix things and work out problems. Yes, you are always going to be upset about what happened when you think about it. I am always going to be upset when I think about the place you put me in.</p>
        <p>My default state is "sure about you"; you are the only one who can change it to "not sure" by not treating me like my person should. And when I am sure about you, I treat you like your person should.</p>
        <p>You coming to Japan would require you to take that leap of faith with me. The one im ready to take. It would require you to prioritise me, make me feel heard and treat me like my person, I'll feel so strongly that you are the one for me. Not just words but tangible actions.</p>
        <p>I want us to start again, rekindle and master love level 3. I want to trust you again, and I want you to trust me again. This is the perfect place to do it.</p>
        <p>I've been trying to make you feel better. I've been trying so hard to patch you up after the mess I made of your heart.</p>
        <p>I know what you are sacrificing, I know you get one shot to be a frep, and I know it's important to you, but I am asking you to give that up for me, to make that sacrifice to help me fix us. It is important to me. I will never forget it. We will never forget this trip.</p>
        <p>Please, Olivia, please my baby, please my love. If any small part of you wants us to work out, if any small part of you wants to move past this, please come. If you are too busy with work, I'll book it for you. You need a holiday anyway.</p>
        <p>You have given me the opportunity to try and fix things with you, and I took it. I am giving you the opportunity to fix things with me by making me feel heard and prioritised, please take it.</p>
        <p>If we work through this, we both work on our own things and we master love level 3, just imagine how high we can fly</p>
        <p> You've always had me in your corner, baby. I only left because I felt like you were content with your brain locking up when stuff got hard. I will always be in your corner if you treat me right.</p>
        <p>"True potential is only reached through the acceptance of uncertainty"</p>
        <p>Love,</p>
        <p>Stinky</p>

        <li> Flights are still cheap but they will go up, currently £570 (£285 if split) for dates 20th Sept - 3rd Oct (CLICK ME)</li>
      </a>
      <li> Free accomodation</li>
      <li> Such a long trip to a dream destination may not be financially possible for the next 4 years. The average price of a 2-week Japan trip is £1500 - £2000</li>
      <li> Even though he doesn't have much in savings, he and his family want to help, ready to put his birthday money to this</li>
      <li> The Yen is at a 15-year low against the Pound, British money goes further than ever in Japan</li>
      <li> A tourist tax will be implemented in November 2026, making it even more expensive after this</li>
      <li> Food is insanely cheap: £100 gets you 20 very nice eating out meals, even more meals if you make your own!</li>
      <li> All transport (except bullet trains) is insanely cheap, £4 for an all-day travel card (compared to £23 on the TFL)</li>

  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Cultrual Reasons</h2>
    <ul class="timeline">
      <li> Japanese food is world-class, some of the tastiest ever made. This means it's home to the best ginger and garlic tofu!</li>
      <li> Her ideals of an affinity for nature and a drive for progress are reflected by the Japanese: Neon-plastered bladerunner-esque sci-fi mega cities next to beautiful, spiritual, well-kept, serene gardens, parks and waterfalls</li>
      <li> Some of the highest rated nightlife and clubs in the world that he wants to dance with her in</li>
      <li> Tokyo is incredibly safe, in fact 500% safer than London (look it up)</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Fashion Reasons</h2>
    <ul class="timeline">
      <li> Tokyo has a massive thrift culture, at the centre of this is the ¥700 stores (roughly £3.50). Antique tees, trousers, shorts, skirts, dresses and bags all £3.50 each. You could build a whole new wardrobe with the same amount she has recently spent in an online store. </li>
      <li> She's really pretty and would look good in a kimono.</li>

    <h2>Olivia Reasons</h2>
    <ul class="timeline">
      <li> She really misses him and has had dreams about running up to him at the airport and being in Tokyo</li>
      <li> But she really wants to Frep because she wants to make new friends, she wants to be more involved in Castle, and she wants to run an event. So here is how to have it all:
        <ul>
          <li> Even though she can be dropped into a whole new environment, even a new country, and make good friends, Castle Running Society is a good place to start. One of the most open societies to newcomers, with weekly runs and lots of socials. She likes running; it's healthy, and the new senior student is very involved. There is no better place to keep a pulse on the Castle Culture.</li>
          <li> Ball or Social Committee allows her to help plan and run an event that has never happened before, as well as do brand new paintings to decorate the Castle instead of touching up the same Fresher's Week banners.</li>
          <li> Warm Hearts Society allows her to surround herself with like-minded people who don't think being loud equals being funny. Knit blankets for the elderly in hospices while socialising with tea and biscuits. It's good for your heart, hands and tummy :)</li>
        </ul>
      These are 3 of many, specifically selected as they were all given awards for outstanding contribution to Castle during the recent colours ceremony. In addition, they are active the whole year and not just 2 weeks.

    <ul class="timeline">
      <li> All of these photos were taken on my phone, so these selfies are possible.</li>
      <li> Not sure why I wrote the whole thing in the third person, but it felt like the right thing to do</li>
      <li> It takes the same format as my website, so it would be pretty easy to make you one from here</li>
      <li> I now own oliviapape.com for the next year lol</li>
